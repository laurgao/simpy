## Benchmarking

I have a benchmarking suite in `benchmark.py`. As of this current commit (June 9th, 2025), the time taken is **0.19s** averaged across 100 runs with stdev 0.01. This is after doing a bunch of rote speed optimizations so it's probably the quickest I'd get for a while.

I want to have this here so that I can ensure that the time does not massively balloon with future modifications.
